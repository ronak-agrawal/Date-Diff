  		-- In terms of years, months and days.
       		-- Is there any leap year in-between?

Application should have:
 
  -- db models and migration
  -- form validations
  -- appropriate error messages
  -- respective unit tests
  -- meaningful API endpoint
 
An explanation for

  -- time and space complexity
  -- justification for selection of approach


<!-- sample dates -->
#   - 11/03/1994 : 03/09/2020 # (37, 8, 26)
   # - 12/12/1999 : 11/05/2004 #(7, 1, 5)
   # - 28/02/2009 : 25/09/2009 #(26, 3, 0)
   # - 16/04/2011 : 15/03/2010 #(1, 1, 1)
   # - 16/08/2013 : 11/02/2014 #(6, 5, 1)
